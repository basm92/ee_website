# Questions

## Housing prices

Consider the following regression output from a model trying to explain the price of a house:
    `price = 300,000 + 1500 * sqmtr`

where `price` is the sale price of a house in euro, and `sqmtr` is the interior surface in square meters. The R-squared is 0.64.

(a) Interpret the intercept (300,000) and the slope coefficient (1,500) in plain English.

(b) What does the R-squared value of 0.64 tell us about this model?

(c) If you were to re-estimate the model with price measured in thousands of euros (e.g., a 250,000 euro house becomes 250), what would the new equation be?

## Log-Log Model

Suppose you run a log-log regression to analyze the relationship between online ad spending and product sales, and you get the following result:

`log(Sales) = 2.1 - 0.85 * log(Ad_Price)`

How would you interpret the coefficient -0.85? What is the economic term for this value?


## Error Term and Residual

What is the fundamental difference between the population error term ($u_i$) and the OLS residual ($e_i$)?

Why can we observe one but not the other?

## Proving a Fundamental OLS Property

The lecture states that the OLS regression line always passes through the point of sample means, $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$. 

Using the formula for the OLS intercept estimator, $\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$, prove that this is true. 

That is, show that if you plug $\bar{x}$ into the estimated regression equation, the predicted value $\hat{y}$ is exactly $\bar{y}$.
  
## Unbiasedness

The unbiasedness of the OLS estimator, $E(\hat{\beta}_1) = \beta_1$, is a cornerstone result that relies on the first four SLR assumptions. Let's prove it. Start with the formula for the slope estimator:
    $$
      \hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
    $$

(a) First, substitute the true population model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i$ into the numerator. Show that the estimator can be rewritten as:

    $$ \hat{\beta}_1 = \beta_1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} $$
   
- *(Hint: You will need to use the fact that $\sum(x_i - \bar{x})(c) = 0$ for any constant c, and that $\sum(x_i - \bar{x})(\bar{y}) = 0$.)*
- *(Hint: A useful property is $\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) = \sum (x_i - \bar{x})y_i$.)*

## Unbiasedness (Cont.)

(b) Now, take the conditional expectation of your result from part (a) with respect to X (the set of all $x_i$ values). Use the Zero Conditional Mean assumption, $E(u_i|X) = 0$, to prove that $E(\hat{\beta}_1|X) = \beta_1$.


## Marginal Effects

The lecture explains how to interpret coefficients in models with different functional forms. 

Use calculus to derive the *marginal effect* of a change in $x$ on $y$ for the following two models:

(a) **The Quadratic Model:** For the model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + u$, find the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$. How does your result show that the effect of a one-unit change in $x$ on $y$ depends on the current level of $x$?

(b) **The Level-Log Model:** For the model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(x) + u$, show that a 1% change in $x$ leads to an approximate change of $(\beta_1/100)$ units in $y$.

*(Hint: For (b), recall that a change in $\log(x)$, i.e., $d(\log(x))$, is equal to $\frac{dx}{x}$, which is the proportional change in x.)*


## Variance of the OLS Estimator

The variance of the OLS estimator in a simple linear regression is given by: $Var(\hat{\beta}_1) = \frac{\sigma^2}{SST_x}$.

Imagine you are a researcher designing an experiment to find the causal effect of fertilizer ($x$) on crop yield ($y$). 

Using this formula as your guide, what two things could you do in your experimental design to increase the *precision* of your estimate, $\hat{\beta}_1$?

## R-squared

A junior analyst tells you, "My model is great, it has an R-squared of 0.92!" 

Why is a high R-squared not necessarily the ultimate goal of an econometric analysis, especially if we are interested in making policy decisions based on one specific variable?

What is often more important than a high R-squared?

## OLS Minimization

Why do we use the *sum of squared residuals* as the criterion to minimize in OLS?

Why not minimize the sum of the absolute values of the residuals, or just the sum of the residuals?

What are the statistical and practical advantages of squaring them?

## Polynomials

The lecture introduced polynomial terms (e.g., adding $x^2$) to model non-linear relationships. 

When might you suspect that a simple linear model is not sufficient and that a quadratic model (like `wage` on `experience` and `experience²`) would be more appropriate?

What would a negative coefficient on the `experience²` term imply about the relationship between experience and wages?
