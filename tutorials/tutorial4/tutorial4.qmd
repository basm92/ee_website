# Tutorial 4

## Recapitulation of the Lecture

## Slide 1

## Slide 2

# Questions

## Interpreting Stationarity
The lecture states that for a time series to be covariance stationary, three conditions must be met (constant mean, constant variance, and constant autocovariance). Explain in your own words why a time series representing the national debt of a country, which has been consistently increasing for the last 50 years, would violate at least two of these conditions.

## ACF and Model Memory
Compare and contrast the theoretical Autocorrelation Function (ACF) of an AR(1) process with $\rho = 0.9$ and an MA(1) process. How does the ACF of each model reflect the "memory" of the process, and what does this imply about how a shock in one period affects future values in each case?

## The Random Walk Hypothesis
The lecture defines a random walk as an AR(1) model with $\rho=1$. If the daily price of a stock is believed to follow a random walk, what is the single best piece of information you could use to forecast its price for tomorrow? Explain why a shock (e.g., unexpected good news) on a given day has a "permanent" effect on the future price path of the stock.

## Spurious Regression Intuition

Imagine you run a regression of the annual number of babies born in Canada on the annual number of storks spotted in Germany over the last 30 years. Both series have a slight upward trend. Based on the lecture's discussion of spurious regression, what results would you expect to see for the R-squared value and the t-statistic of the "storks" coefficient? Why would these results be misleading?

## The Role of the Breusch-Godfrey Test

You estimate a linear model $Y_t = \alpha + \beta X_t + \epsilon_t$ and suspect the relationship might be spurious. You run a Breusch-Godfrey test with an order of p=2 and get a very small p-value (e.g., 0.001). What is the null hypothesis of this test, and what does this result tell you about the error term $\epsilon_t$? How does this finding support the concern about a spurious regression?

## ARDL Model Interpretation
In an ARDL(1,1) model, $Y_t = \alpha + \rho_1 Y_{t-1} + \beta_0 X_t + \beta_1 X_{t-1} + u_t$, the long-run multiplier is given by the formula $\theta = (\beta_0 + \beta_1) / (1 - \rho_1)$. Provide an intuitive explanation for why we divide the sum of the X-coefficients by $(1 - \rho_1)$. What role does the persistence factor, $\rho_1$, play in determining the total long-run effect?

## Analyzing the Simulated Correlogram

Look at the "Simulated Correlogram (ACF Plot)" in the lecture.
a) The autocorrelation at Lag 1 is approximately 0.8. What does this value tell you about the relationship between an observation and its immediately preceding value?
b) The plot shows the autocorrelations decaying and moving towards zero as the lag increases. Is this behavior more consistent with a stationary or a non-stationary process? Why?

## Interpreting the Simulated AR(1) Process Plot

Examine the plot titled "Simulation of a Stationary AR(1) Process."
a) The simulation was generated with $\rho=0.9$ and a theoretical mean of 20. Does the plotted series appear to be stationary? Explain your reasoning by referring to the visual characteristics of the plot (e.g., its movement around the mean).
b) If the autoregressive parameter $\rho$ were changed from 0.9 to 0.2, how would you expect the appearance of the time series plot to change? Would it look more or less "jagged"?

## Contrasting Stationary and Non-Stationary Plots

Compare the "Simulation of a Stationary AR(1) Process" plot with the "Simulation of a Random Walk" plot.
a) What is the most obvious visual difference between the two simulations?
b) The AR(1) plot has a red dashed line indicating the theoretical mean, but the Random Walk plot does not. Based on the properties of a random walk discussed in the lecture, explain why plotting a constant mean would be inappropriate for that series.

## Interpreting Breusch-Godfrey Test R Code Output

In the R example for the Breusch-Godfrey test, the output for `bg_test_order1` shows a very small p-value.
a) What specific statistical conclusion do you draw from this result?
b) The OLS regression summary for `ols_model` shows that the coefficient on `X` is statistically significant. Given the result of the Breusch-Godfrey test, why should you be skeptical of the reliability of this significance test?

## Interpreting Distributed Lag Model Coefficients

Suppose you estimate the following Distributed Lag (DL) model to assess the effect of advertising spending (AD) on sales (S), both measured in thousands of dollars:
$S_t = 20 + 1.5 AD_t + 1.1 AD_{t-1} + 0.6 AD_{t-2} + u_t$
a) What is the immediate impact on sales of a $1,000 increase in advertising spending?
b) What is the total, long-run effect on sales of a permanent $1,000 increase in advertising spending?

## Analyzing ARDL Model Python Code

In the Python code example for estimating an ARDL model, imagine the final output for the `long_run_effects` is:
```
LRY      1.25
IBO     -0.80
const    5.50
dtype: float64
```
Based on this output, what would be the total expected change in the long-run equilibrium level of `LRM` if `LRY` permanently increases by one unit, assuming `IBO` remains constant?
