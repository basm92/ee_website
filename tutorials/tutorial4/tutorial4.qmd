# Questions

## Forecasting US Economic Growth

This question focuses on **univariate modeling and prediction**. You will model the fertility rate using the `FERTIL3.DTA` dataset. Import it into R/Python/Stata and 

1. Fit an Autoregressive, AR(p), model. Use an information criterion (like the AIC or BIC/SIC) to select the optimal number of lags, `p`.

2. Using the autoregressive specification you've found, compute (by hand) a forcast of two periods into the future. 

2. Generate a forecast from your fitted model for 10 periods after the end of the dataset. 

3. What happens to the forecast after a certain number of periods?


## Investigating Stationarity and Spurious Regression

This question tests your ability to identify **non-stationary data and avoid spurious regression**. You will investigate the relationship between housing inventory (the dependent variable) and population size (the independent variable) from the `HSEINV.DTA` dataset. 

1. Run a simple OLS regression with the Housing Inventory (`inv`) as the dependent variable and Population (`pop`) as the independent variable.

2. Report the R-squared value and the t-statistic (or p-value) for the `inv` coefficient. What would a naive interpretation of these results suggest about the relationship between these two variables?

3. Run the Breusch-Godfrey test with `order=1` and report the $p$-value. What does this suggest? 

4. Repeat step 1 and 3, but include the lagged housing inventory, `linv`, and the lagged population `lpop` as independent variables. What do you conclude? 

## Derivation of the Unconditional Mean of an AR(1) Process

The lecture notes mention that for a stationary AR(1) process, $Y_t = \alpha + \rho Y_{t-1} + u_t$ (with $|\rho|<1$), the unconditional mean is $E(Y_t) = \frac{\alpha}{1-\rho}$.

Prove this result.

*Hint: Start by taking the expected value of both sides of the AR(1) equation. Then, use the stationarity assumption, which implies that $E(Y_t) = E(Y_{t-1}) = \mu$, and solve for $\mu$.*

## Statistical Properties of an MA(1) Process

Consider the Moving Average model of order 1, or MA(1):
$Y_t = \mu + u_t + \theta u_{t-1}$
where $u_t$ is a white noise process with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2_u$.

Derive the following properties for the MA(1) process:

  1. The mean: $E(Y_t)$
  2. The variance: $Var(Y_t) = \gamma_0$
  3. The first-order autocovariance: $Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-1}) = \gamma_1$
  4. The second-order autocovariance: $Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-2}) = \gamma_2$
  5. Based on your result for (d), what can you conclude about the "memory" of an MA(1) process?

## Proving the Stationarity of a Differenced Random Walk

A random walk, $Y_t = Y_{t-1} + u_t$, is the classic example of a non-stationary process. The lecture suggests that differencing the data can induce stationarity.

Show that the first difference of a random walk, defined as $\Delta Y_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1}$, is a stationary process.

*Hint: To prove stationarity, you must show that $\Delta Y_t$ satisfies the three conditions: constant mean, constant variance, and constant autocovariance that depends only on the lag.*

## The Koyck Transformation

The lecture introduces the Koyck (Geometric) Distributed Lag model, which transforms an infinite lag model into a simple autoregressive form.

Start with the infinite lag model where the coefficients decline geometrically:
$$Y_t = \alpha + \beta_0 X_t + \beta_0 \lambda X_{t-1} + \beta_0 \lambda^2 X_{t-2} + \dots + u_t$$

Show all the algebraic steps required to transform this equation into the ARDL form:
$$Y_t = \alpha(1-\lambda) + \beta_0 X_t + \lambda Y_{t-1} + v_t$$
where $v_t = u_t - \lambda u_{t-1}$.

*Hint: Write out the equation for $Y_{t-1}$, multiply it by $\lambda$, and then subtract this new equation from the original equation for $Y_t$.*

## Calculating the Long-Run Multiplier for a Specific ARDL Model

The lecture provides the general formula for the Long-Run Multiplier (LRM). Now, apply that logic to a specific case. Consider the following ARDL(2,1) model:

$$Y_t = 10 + 0.5 Y_{t-1} + 0.2 Y_{t-2} + 2.0 X_t - 0.8 X_{t-1} + u_t$$

**Task:** Calculate the Long-Run Multiplier for this model.

  1. First, derive the algebraic expression for the LRM using the equilibrium condition where $Y_t = Y_{t-1} = Y_{t-2} = Y_{eq}$ and $X_t = X_{t-1} = X_{eq}$.
  2. Second, substitute the numerical coefficients from the model to find the value of the LRM.
  3. Provide a one-sentence interpretation of the numerical value you calculated.

## The Random Walk Hypothesis

The lecture defines a random walk as an AR(1) model with $\rho=1$. If the daily price of a stock is believed to follow a random walk, what is the single best piece of information you could use to forecast its price for tomorrow? Explain why a shock (e.g., unexpected good news) on a given day has a "permanent" effect on the future price path of the stock.

## The Role of the Breusch-Godfrey Test

You estimate a linear model $Y_t = \alpha + \beta X_t + \epsilon_t$ and suspect the relationship might be spurious. You run a Breusch-Godfrey test with an order of p=2 and get a very small p-value (e.g., 0.001). 

What is the null hypothesis of this test, and what does this result tell you about the error term $\epsilon_t$? How does this finding support the concern about a spurious regression?

## ARDL Model Interpretation

In an ARDL(1,1) model, $Y_t = \alpha + \rho_1 Y_{t-1} + \beta_0 X_t + \beta_1 X_{t-1} + u_t$, the long-run multiplier is given by the formula $\theta = (\beta_0 + \beta_1) / (1 - \rho_1)$. 

Provide an intuitive explanation for why we divide the sum of the X-coefficients by $(1 - \rho_1)$. What role does the persistence factor, $\rho_1$, play in determining the total long-run effect?
