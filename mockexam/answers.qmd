## Answer Key

1.  **b)** The goal is to forecast a value ($\hat{y}$) as accurately as possible, which is the definition of a prediction task.

2.  **d)** The data tracks the same cross-sectional units (individuals) over multiple time periods, which defines panel data.

3.  **c)** One of the OLS First Order Conditions directly implies that the sum of the explanatory variable multiplied by the residual is zero ($\sum x_i \hat{u}_i = 0$), which means their sample covariance is zero.

4.  **b)** In a log-log model, the slope coefficient is an elasticity, representing the percentage change in the dependent variable for a 1% change in the independent variable.

5.  **b)** For males, the dummy variable `Female` is 0. Therefore, the predicted wage is $\widehat{\text{Wage}} = 22.50 - 3.75 \times (0) = 22.50$. The intercept represents the average value for the reference group.

6.  **c)** R-squared measures the proportion of the sample variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s).

7.  **c)** The omitted variable ("parental involvement") has a positive effect on test scores ($\beta_2 > 0$). It is negatively correlated with the included variable, ClassSize ($\delta_1 < 0$). The bias is the product of these two effects: $(\text{positive}) \times (\text{negative}) = \text{negative bias}$. This negative bias will make the estimated coefficient for class size more negative (i.e., appear larger in magnitude) than the true effect.

8.  **d)** The formula for the variance is $\widehat{Var}(\hat{\beta}_1) = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{SST_x}$. To decrease the variance, one must either decrease the numerator (error variance) or increase the denominator. Increasing the variation in the explanatory variable ($SST_x$) increases the denominator, thus decreasing the overall variance.

9. **c)** The student must start with the formula relating the estimated coefficient to the true coefficient and the bias:

$E[\hat{\alpha}_1] = \beta_1 + \text{Bias}$

Then, use the specific formula for omitted variable bias:
$\text{Bias} = \beta_2 \cdot \delta_1$

From the problem description:

*   The true effect of the included variable is $\beta_1 = 2.5$.
*   The true effect of the omitted variable is $\beta_2 = 4.0$.
*   The coefficient from the auxiliary regression of the omitted variable on the included variable is $\delta_1 = 0.5$.

First, calculate the bias:
$\text{Bias} = 4.0 \times 0.5 = 2.0$

Next, use this to find the expected value of the estimated coefficient:
$E[\hat{\alpha}_1] = 2.5 + 2.0 = 4.5$

10. **c)** Use the formula of the estimated model to derive the expected wage for each category and then find the difference.

**Expected wage for a Finance worker:** For this person, `Finance` = 1 and `Retail` = 0.
    $E[\text{Wage} | \text{Finance}] = 18.50 - 2.10 \times (0) + 5.40 \times (1) = 18.50 + 5.40 = 23.90$

**Expected wage for a Retail worker:** For this person, `Retail` = 1 and `Finance` = 0.
    $E[\text{Wage} | \text{Retail}] = 18.50 - 2.10 \times (1) + 5.40 \times (0) = 18.50 - 2.10 = 16.40$

**Calculate the difference:**
    Difference = $E[\text{Wage} | \text{Finance}] - E[\text{Wage} | \text{Retail}]$
    Difference = $23.90 - 16.40 = 7.50$

*Alternative algebraic derivation:*
Let $\hat{\beta}_0 = 18.50$, $\hat{\beta}_1 = -2.10$, and $\hat{\beta}_2 = 5.40$.
The difference is $(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_2) - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1) = \hat{\beta}_2 - \hat{\beta}_1 = 5.40 - (-2.10) = 5.40 + 2.10 = 7.50$.

11.  **c)** The effect of a one-unit change in $x_1$ on $y$, holding $x_2$ constant.

12.  **c)** A confounder, and failing to control for it will likely lead to omitted variable bias.

13.  **b)** An F-test for the overall significance of the regression.

14.  **c)** The standard errors for the coefficients $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_2$ will be large.

15.  **d)** The difference in the return to an additional year of education for females compared to males.

16.  **c)** The lecture explicitly states that if $|\rho|=1$, the series is non-stationary and is called a random walk, where shocks have a permanent effect.

17.  **b)** The Long-Run Multiplier is defined as the total effect on Y after a permanent change in X has fully worked through the system, and it is calculated as the ratio of the sum of the distributed lag coefficients to one minus the sum of the autoregressive coefficients.

18. **c)** For an MA(q) model, any forecast for a horizon h > q will only involve future error terms, whose conditional expectation is zero. Therefore, the forecast reverts to the process mean: $\hat{Y}_{t+h|t} = \mu$.
