## Instructions

This midterm contains 20 MC questions and 5 open questions, and will count for 40% of the final grade. All MC questions have equal weight (1pt). The duration of this exam is 2 hours. 

## Question 1

A financial analyst builds a model to forecast next month's stock price for a specific company using historical price data, trading volume, and market sentiment indicators. The analyst's primary objective is to make the forecast as accurate as possible. Which of the following best describes the main goal of this econometric exercise?

a) Causal inference, focusing on the estimated coefficient ($\hat{\beta}$) for trading volume.
b) Prediction, focusing on the accuracy of the predicted value ($\hat{y}$).
c) Evaluating the goodness-of-fit using the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR).
d) Testing the hypothesis that market sentiment has a non-zero effect on the stock price.

## Question 2

A researcher is studying the economic impact of a new public transit line. They collect data on income, employment status, and commute times for the *same* 5,000 individuals every year, starting two years before the line opened and continuing for five years after. What type of data does this represent?

a) Cross-sectional data
b) Time series data
c) Pooled cross-sections
d) Panel (or longitudinal) data


## Question 3

A researcher estimates the following simple linear regression model using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):
$Wage_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 Educ_i + \hat{u}_i$

Based on the first-order conditions used to derive the OLS estimators, which of the following statements about the residuals ($\hat{u}_i$) and the explanatory variable ($Educ_i$) is mathematically guaranteed to be true in the sample?

a) The sample correlation between the residuals and the dependent variable ($Wage_i$) is zero.
b) The sum of the squared residuals is equal to the total sum of squares ($\sum \hat{u}_i^2 = SST$).
c) The sample covariance between the residuals and the explanatory variable ($Educ_i$) is zero.
d) The residuals ($\hat{u}_i$) are all equal to zero.


## Question 4

A marketing analyst estimates the relationship between monthly product sales and advertising spending using a log-log model:

$\widehat{\log(\text{Sales})} = 3.8 + 0.45 \times \log(\text{AdSpend})$

Where `Sales` is the number of units sold and `AdSpend` is the advertising expenditure in euros. How should the coefficient on $\log(\text{AdSpend})$ (0.45) be interpreted?

a) A €1 increase in advertising spending is associated with a 0.45% increase in sales.
b) A 1% increase in advertising spending is associated with a 0.45% increase in sales.
c) A 1% increase in advertising spending is associated with an increase in sales of 0.45 units.
d) A €1 increase in advertising spending is associated with an increase in sales of 0.45 units.

## Question 5

Consider the regression of individual hourly wage on a single dummy variable, `Female`, which equals 1 for females and 0 for males. The estimated equation is:
$\widehat{\text{Wage}} = 22.50 - 3.75 \times \text{Female}$

Based on this output, what is the predicted average hourly wage for males in the sample?

a) €26.25
b) €22.50
c) €18.75
d) €3.75


## Question 6

An economist is investigating the factors that determine CEO salary. The simple regression of salary on firm profits yields an R-squared of 0.09. Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this R-squared value?

a) There is a 9% chance that the relationship between profits and salary is causal.
b) For every €1 increase in profits, CEO salary increases by 9%.
c) 9% of the variation in CEO salary in the sample can be explained by the variation in firm profits.
d) The estimated coefficient for profits is biased by 9%.


## Question 7

A researcher wants to estimate the causal effect of class size on student test scores. They run the following regression:
$\text{TestScore} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{ClassSize} + u$

However, they fail to include a variable for the average "parental involvement" at the school. It is likely that schools with higher parental involvement have better resources and thus smaller class sizes (a negative correlation). It is also likely that higher parental involvement directly leads to better test scores (a positive effect). What is the likely direction of the omitted variable bias on the estimated coefficient $\hat{\beta}_1$?

a) There will be no bias because OLS is always unbiased.
b) The bias will be positive, making the negative effect of class size appear smaller than it truly is.
c) The bias will be negative, making the negative effect of class size appear larger than it truly is.
d) The direction of the bias cannot be determined without knowing the R-squared of the model.


## Question 8

An analyst is trying to get a more precise estimate of the relationship between marketing expenditure and sales. The variance of the OLS slope estimator, $\widehat{Var}(\hat{\beta}_1)$, depends on several factors. Which of the following changes would *decrease* the variance of the estimated coefficient on marketing expenditure, leading to a more precise estimate?

a) A decrease in the sample size ($n$).
b) An increase in the variance of the error term ($\sigma^2$).
c) A decrease in the variation of marketing expenditure in the sample ($SST_x$).
d) An increase in the variation of marketing expenditure in the sample ($SST_x$).

## Question 9

An economist wants to estimate the true effect of education on wages. The true population model is:
$Wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Education} + \beta_2 \text{Ability} + u$

The true parameters are known to be $\beta_1 = 2.5$ and $\beta_2 = 4.0$. However, the economist cannot observe "Ability" and estimates a simpler model:
$Wage = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \text{Education} + v$

It is also known that in the population, the relationship between Ability and Education can be described by the linear model: $\text{Ability} = \delta_0 + 0.5 \times \text{Education} + w$.

Given this information, what is the expected value of the OLS estimator $\hat{\alpha}_1$ that the economist will obtain from the simpler model? (Hint: Start with the formula for Omitted Variable Bias).

a) 2.5
b) 2.0
c) 4.5
d) 6.5


## Question 10

A researcher estimates a model for an individual's hourly wage based on their industry sector, using the "Manufacturing" sector as the omitted reference category. The estimated model is:

$\widehat{\text{Wage}} = 18.50 - 2.10 \times \text{Retail} + 5.40 \times \text{Finance}$

Where `Retail` and `Finance` are dummy variables equal to 1 if the individual works in that sector, and 0 otherwise.

Based on this model, what is the estimated average wage difference between a worker in the Finance sector and a worker in the Retail sector?

a) €5.40
b) €3.30
c) €7.50
d) €2.10


## Question 11

In a multiple linear regression model, $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + u$, what is the correct interpretation of the coefficient $\beta_1$?

a) The total effect of a one-unit change in $x_1$ on $y$.
b) The correlation between $x_1$ and $y$.
c) The effect of a one-unit change in $x_1$ on $y$, holding $x_2$ constant.
d) The average value of $y$ when $x_1$ is equal to 1.

## Question 12

A researcher is estimating the effect of education on wages and is concerned about a person's innate ability. In this context, innate ability is likely a classic example of what?

a) A collider variable, which will induce a spurious correlation if controlled for.
b) A mediating variable, which should not be controlled for if one wants to measure the total effect.
c) A confounder, and failing to control for it will likely lead to omitted variable bias.
d) An irrelevant variable that will only decrease the model's R-squared.

## Question 13

An analyst wants to test the hypothesis that *none* of the independent variables in their model have any explanatory power. The null hypothesis is $H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \dots = \beta_k = 0$. Which test is appropriate for this purpose?

a) A series of individual t-tests for each coefficient.
b) An F-test for the overall significance of the regression.
c) A test for heteroskedasticity.
d) A test for the R-squared value.

## Question 14

What is the primary consequence of high (but not perfect) multicollinearity between two independent variables, $x_1$ and $x_2$, in a regression model?

a) The coefficient estimates for $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ will be biased.
b) The R-squared of the model will be artificially low.
c) The standard errors for the coefficients $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_2$ will be large.
d) The intercept of the model, $\hat{\beta}_0$, will be biased, but other coefficients will be unaffected.

## Question 15

Consider the regression model: $Wage_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Female_i + \beta_2 Educ_i + \beta_3 (Female_i \cdot Educ_i) + u_i$. What does the coefficient $\beta_3$ represent?

a) The average wage for females with zero years of education.
b) The effect of an additional year of education on wages for females.
c) The wage difference between females and males for those with zero years of education.
d) The difference in the return to an additional year of education for females compared to males.


## Question 16

An AR(1) model is defined as $Y_t = α + \rho Y_{t-1} + u_t$. What happens if the autoregressive coefficient $|\rho|$ is equal to 1?

A) The series is stationary, and shocks die out quickly.
B) The series is explosive, and its value grows infinitely.
C) The series is non-stationary and is called a random walk, where shocks have a permanent effect.
D) The model becomes a white noise process, as past values have no influence.

## Question 17

In an Autoregressive Distributed Lag ARDL(p,q) model, how is the long-run multiplier for an explanatory variable X interpreted?

A) It is the immediate impact on Y from a one-unit change in X.
B) It is the total long-run change in Y after a permanent one-unit increase in X has fully worked through the system.
C) It represents the sum of the autoregressive coefficients, measuring the persistence of the Y variable.
D) It is the average of all short-run coefficients in the model.


## Question 18

Consider forecasting with a Moving Average MA(q) model: $Y_t = \mu + u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q}$. What is the forecast for a time period far in the future (i.e., for a forecast horizon $h > q$)?

A) The forecast will converge to zero.
B) The forecast will continue the most recent trend.
C) The forecast will revert to the mean of the process, $\mu$.
D) The forecast is impossible to calculate because future error terms are unknown.

**Question 3:**
When comparing econometric models, how does the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) generally differ from the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)?

A) AIC imposes a larger penalty for extra parameters, leading to simpler models.
B) BIC and AIC always select the same model regardless of sample size.
C) BIC imposes a larger penalty for extra parameters, especially in larger samples, and tends to select more parsimonious (simpler) models.
D) BIC is a measure of model fit, while AIC is a measure of forecast accuracy.

**Correct Answer: C**
**Explanation:** The presentation notes that for a sample size n ≥ 8, the penalty in BIC is larger than in AIC. As a result, "BIC has a stronger tendency to select more parsimonious (simpler) models than AIC."

**Question 4:**
What is the primary reason that running an OLS regression on two unrelated, non-stationary time series can lead to a "spurious regression"?

A) The high R-squared and significant t-statistics are driven by the common underlying trends in the variables, not a true relationship.
B) OLS cannot be used for time series data under any circumstances.
C) The error terms in a spurious regression are guaranteed to be white noise, which misleads the researcher.
D) The sample size is too small to establish a meaningful relationship.

**Correct Answer: A**
**Explanation:** The lecture explains that a spurious regression occurs when two variables appear related because both have strong trends (are non-stationary), leading to high R-squared and significant t-statistics even when they are actually unrelated.

**Question 7:**
The Breusch-Godfrey test is used to detect a specific problem in a time series regression. What is the null hypothesis ($H_0$) of this test?

A) The model's coefficients are jointly equal to zero.
B) The variance of the error term is constant (homoscedasticity).
C) The variables in the model are non-stationary.
D) There is no serial correlation (autocorrelation) in the error terms.

**Correct Answer: D**
**Explanation:** The lecture defines the Breusch-Godfrey test by stating its null hypothesis is $H_0: \rho_1, \dots, \rho_p=0$, which means there is no serial correlation up to order p in the residuals.

***

**Question 8:**
What is the key difference between an Autoregressive (AR) model and a Moving Average (MA) model?

A) AR models use past values of the variable itself to explain the current value, while MA models use past random shocks (error terms).
B) AR models are only suitable for stationary data, while MA models can be used for non-stationary data.
C) AR models always have a finite memory, while MA models have an infinite memory.
D) AR models are used for forecasting, while MA models are used for policy analysis.

**Correct Answer: A**
**Explanation:** The lecture defines the AR model as $Y_t = α + \rho Y_{t-1} + u_t$ (a function of its own past) and the MA model as $Y_t = \mu + u_t + \theta u_{t-1}$ (a function of past shocks).
